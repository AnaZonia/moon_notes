- PhD in renewable resources - am curious to hear about it.

Metacommunity Ecology - Leibold & Chase (main text in metacommunity ecology)

Genetic makeup of a community affects its structure - I am curious as to how genetic engineering can help overcome cheetah-like bottlenecks in gen. diversity.

Metacommunity concept can also be applied to microbiota and parasites (with patches as hosts)

Metacommunities have been studied theoretically and empirically -> mixing them together is such a cool idea, and not very well studied yet. 

He may be a cool contact for Shriram.

**Variation partitioning** - how much of the variance is explained by spatial, environmental, and interaction variables.
- depending on which fraction is significant, yhere are different types of community

only environment -> species sorting
only space -> neutral patch
both -> species sorting or mass effect

*Partial canonical ordinations* are used to test fractions.

Hard to know how co-distribution doesn't mean interaction -> 

Multivariate normal -> vectors of means and covariance matrix

Latent variables -> variation that is not measured by environment and space. Could be co-distribution, or whatever else. Any variable that is not sampled: an axis of a PCA is a latent variable for example.
- Sparse Bayesian Infinite Factor Models in Biometrika explains how they work

From the latent variables, they get a correlation matrix that shows how species relate to each other.

Latent variables can be "too good at modelling everything" - I wonder what he means?

Distance-based Moran's eigenvector maps allow to understand the spatial structure.

A statistical model linking theory and data -> the expectation of extinction assumes a Poisson or negative binomial distribution

Isolation of patch (0 unoccupied or 1 occupied) depends on migration rate, size of patch, and distance between patches

With this we model the expected isolation of a local population

Multivariate hierarchical model, we can link the parameters from theory to data.

Theoretically interpretable parameters.

Theory can help inform the limits to the ecology that you can infer from your system

Data integration -> use different types of data together to build a better model.
- May be able to integrate collar tracking and sighting data.
