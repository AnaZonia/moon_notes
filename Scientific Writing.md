## Article Writing

### General tips
- One point per paragraph, one paragraph per point.
- *Write as you would speak* - maybe speak out the text first, and then organize it as it's easier for the words to flow. ChatGPT can help transcribe spoken text to something acceptable.
- When stuck, *writing by hand can help*.
- Use "mentor papers", papers you liked from the journal you might aim for, as reference. Find out why you liked them and do the same
- *Add subheadings* - you can always take them away later.
- Keep terms consistent (avoid synonyms)
- Paragraphs should connect clearly to paragraph before
- When you zoom in, explain why (when you talked about human impacts and then mentioned surrounding forest cover, did you say why that matters?)
- Short sentences for:
	- The beginning of paragraphs
	- Highlighting important points (<10 words)
- Longer sentences for:
	- Lists
	- Elaboration of old information
	- Two part sentences (By doing X, we can Y)

### Avoid:
- Using a "back to front" sentence structure, when the verb comes late into the sentence (often involves passive voice)
- Clauses in the middle of the sentences (phrases nested by two commas)
- Passive voice
- Weak verbs such as to be and to have (use "tested" instead of "was a test")
- Abstract nouns (illustration, demonstration, understanding)
- Starting paragraphs with undefined pronouns (these, this)
- Starting paragraphs with clauses that are the second part of an argument (nonetheless, however)
- Paragraphs longer than 15 lines (Times 12pt)
- Sentences longer than 40 words (keep 15-25 on average)
- Hyperbole (extremely, massive)
- Self-aggrandizement (exciting, unprecedented)
- Assumptions (obviously, clearly)
- Complicated words (prefer use to utilize)
- Noun strings (no more than 3 nouns in a row - avoid "seed predation intensity", prefer "intensity of predation on seeds")
- Acronyms (if needed, make them memorable)
- Throwing your field under the bus (don't say everyone sucks - say how you are adding to it)
- Terms whose meaning are not clear ("comprehensive", "systematic", if you don't explain what these terms mean in the given context)
- Using more than one switch ('however') per paragraph
- Non-directional words to explain relationships (prefer "increased/decreased with" to "varied, changed, differed")

### Outline
Can help make the paper more clear, concise, and skimmable.

Write down each part of your pitch in 20 words or less:
- Baby: Motivator (Why do we care?)
- Werewolf: Problem (Knowledge gap that needs filling)
- Silver Bullet: Your contribution (How your study fills the gap)

Make the pitch as broad as possible (broadly loveable baby) to appeal to editors/reviewers that come from diverse backgrounds. The outline should make your pitch clear.

Each paragraph point should be:
- No longer than one line
- A complete statement (except for methods, in which it's less clear)
- Not necessarily the same as a topic sentence
	- Topic sentence: introduces the paragraph
	- Paragraph point: take-home point of the paragraph

Sections should:
- Tell the same story
- Share structure when possible (what is the logic among paragraphs in a section, and among sentences in a paragraph?)
	- chronological
	- general to specific
	- problem to solution
	- least important to most important

Topic sentences should:
- Introduce the paragraph
- Help skimability
- Make sense without needing the paragraph before it
- Be broad enough to cover the entire paragraph
- Connect clearly to the previous paragraph


### Title
- shorter titles that cite results are cited more
- Interesting to write a title as personifying the object of study, when speaking to the public.

### Abstract
![[Scientific Writing.png]]

Should follow a similar structure to the entire paper:

**Intro**
- Introduce baby and werewolf
- Foreshadow methods
- Should be clear to any biologist
- Should be compelling: a "sales pitch".
**Methods**
- Introduce broadly the approach and scope of study (what was done where)
**Results**
- 1-3 most important results
- Start with broad summary sentence = paper's take home message
- easily tie back to methods and baby/werewolf
**Discussion**
- Show bigger implications

### Introduction (4-6 paragraphs, <1200 words)
- Get quickly to the core part of your research - background is good, but making the main point early is helpful.
- Topics should be introduced in the first paragraph in the same order as they are talked about in the rest of the introduction
- Issues should be introduced in the same order as questions/methods
  
**Context (1-2 paragraphs)**
- First paragraph: Baby. Biggest picture. Defines the audience.
- Establish importance of your topic
- Broadly explain the werewolf
**Need (1-2 paragraphs)**
- State need for your work (knowledge gap, werewolf)
**What you did (1-2 paragraphs)**
- Give enough context to keep readers interested. Establish characters, method, place
- Last paragraph: Preview paragraph
	- Mention topics in the same order they came through in the introduction

### Methods (<12 paragraphs)
- Start by setting the stage ("Study system and species")
- Break into Experiment 1, 2, 3 or Question 1, 2, 3
- Start with the why (which all readers care about) before the how (which only some readers care about)
	"we tested X using Y model" rather than "we used Y model to test X"

### Results (<10 paragraphs)
- If possible, maintain same structure from methods (numbered experiments or questions)
- Most important results go in figures
- Tell readers how different results relate to each other
- Remind readers what acronyms are about if you only defined them in intro
- Explain the biological meaning of results (your paper is not about modelling, it's about biology!)
	not "the interaction was not significant" but 'the effect of X did not vary with Y"
- Start with the biology and only after explain details "this had an effect on that (model results)" rather than "model results indicate that ..."
- Figures are good to show patterns in data
- Tables are good for comparisons
- Headings and captions should be biologically meaningful
- Headings and captions should make sense by themselves (without needing text to explain what that means)

### Discussion (4-8 paragraphs)
- First paragraph
	- Summarize results and their interpretation
	- Make clear how separate results relate
- Show how results relate to werewolf (literature context)
	- Are they confirmatory? Contradictory?
- Show importance of results delivering on introduction promises
- Refer back to the figures that back up each result
- Don't dwell too much on study limitations
- Have only one goal per paragraph. Options are things like:
	- Resolve inconsistent results
	- Put results in context of literature
	- Highlight unexpected results
	- Discuss caveats or limitations
	- Discuss alternative interpretations
	- Recap how the needle has moved forward in science
	- Suggest future avenues
	- Conclusion (must say something new)



## Science/Nature-format writing

- Methods (what you did) take a back seat to results/discussion (what you found/what that means)
	- instead of "here's a cool model", "here's the conclusions about this and why they are exciting"
- Need a striking result (something that makes you go "wow!")
	- Here is how much better this model is in comparison with previous models
	- Here is how much surrounding mature forests are important for regrowth
- Need beautiful figures
- Concise writing

Describe your research in six words:
- Modelling forest regrowth at local scales
- Predicting forest regrowth given human impact

Describe why your research matters in one sentence:
- Conserving tropical forests and predicting the impacts of climate change requires reliable local-scale forest regrowth predictions.
- Local-scale regrowth predictions improve carbon sequestration predictions and help forest management.
- Current models do not account for local heterogeneity, impacting carbon sequestration predictions and forest management.



Current tropical forest regrowth models do not account for local heterogeneity, impacting carbon sequestration predictions and forest management. Here, we develop a multivariate process-based model to improve biomass accumulation estimates at local scales in the Brazilian Amazon and Atlantic Forests. Incorporating the biomass of neighboring mature forests as an asymptote, as well as context-specific predictors such as fire frequency and surrounding mature forest cover, more than triples explained variance. Additionally, we estimate a 20-year delay between regrowth onset and its detection by remote sensing algorithms. Accounting for this delay and future climate projections, we estimate that secondary forests in the Brazilian Amazon could sequester approximately X MgC/ha over 15 years, a rate twice as high as would be expected without accounting for the delay. Our findings highlight the importance of secondary forests for carbon sequestration and the role of surrounding mature forests in promoting regrowth.

## Grant writing

> Who are you writing for? What is their agenda?

They want a **good, feasible** idea.

- Why this question
- Why this approach
- Why now
- Why you (expertise and credibility)
- What is the product and who is it useful for? (tangible outcome)
	- Make it **specific and achievable**.
- Feasibility (time, money)

Often grants require reporting, even 5 years later. Keep track of publicly available data and ways in which your work was used.

What separates really good grants?
- Past predicts future performance - show evidence of that
- Well grounded in literature, but looks like a leap forward
- Do you know what to do even if it fails?

## Olivia Milloway's tips
- Think of communicating with a 13 year old - that is when most people stop taking science classes.
	- also useful for interdisciplinary communication!
- Write personal journal entries - forces you out of 3rd person objective voice. Could work in a blog format.
- Build a professional website. It can have a news/stories page.
	- Species feature/naturalist diary - talk about special tree species/groups. Reminds me of "um pé de que?"
		- plantas alimenticias não típicas
		- non timber forest products

It becomes impossible to have children in a scientist job - scientists dont have a firm job until very late in their career.

foreigners that come do science in Brazil
- write your own personal environmental story
	- and a 300-word bio version

### Pixar Method

Imagine your story as if it was a Pixar movie:

**Once upon a time,** there was a big forest that had been cut down and burned to give space for agriculture.

**Every day,** farms were abandoned so new baby forests could grow on the empty land, but it was hard to predict how quickly they would grow back.

**Then one day,** we decided to learn how the ways in which the land was burned and cropped would change the way the forest grows.

**Because of that** we could consider how the quality of the soil can affect regrowing forests

**And because of that** we can make better predictions of how these forests will grow

**Until finally** we can better plan where reforestation efforts should be implemented to bring the forest back faster
