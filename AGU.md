GEDI for savannas - GEDI has large errors of 50-100% in areas with less than 60 mgc /ha - New GEDI Footprint Level Biomass Models for Southern African Savannas - Wessels et al.
- developed models to estimate biomass in GEDI footprints that coincide with airborne lidar. Random Forest did very well.
- wonder how much of this can be done with Agua Salud?

James Kellner - Updated models for release-3 GEDI aboveground biomass density. They are looking for plot-level and airborne lidar data to increase coverage in underrepresented region.
I would like to ask him about covering better secondary forests.
- deciduous broadleaf forests of the tropics are not included yet - caatinga?

unveiling biomass discrepancies assessing land carbon

Lei Ma: future projections of carbon accumulation would be interesting.

Lin Xiong: hybrid approach with ICESat-2 and GEDI. ICESat -2 is more useful to fill gaps in boreal forests, gedi does better in the tropics.
