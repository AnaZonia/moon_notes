## Remote sensing to characterize forest diversity

- Hyperspectral data can highlight functional differences


Trumbore et al 2015 Science

The C sink/source was identified by satellite that measures CO2 in the atmosphere

Liu Eldering 2017 Science


Cavender-Bares 2022 Nature Eco Evo - species richness and carbon vary with differnt tropical forests - good study that shows how carbon, richness cluster with region


Functional diversity is important to see how that relates to resilience to disturbance.
- there are variations in functional diversity that can be identified from remote sensing because they change with major groups (angiosperms, gymnosperms)

==New missions for hyperspectral satellites by ESA - is that part of the plan? because airborne can be expensive and restricted in space.==

Different clustering levels highlight different nested categories of forest based on functional traits measured by both LiDAR and hyperspectral airborne, which is interesting!


Growth rates are different for different forest types - this would be an interesting level to fit the model to.

There is much variation beyond forest/non-forest, and even beyond mature/secondary.

Going beyond multispectral
- GH4 emissions
- canopy traits

EMIT
SBG mission

- immense opportunities for data fusion (new sensors coming out!)
- overcome data gaps to make sure advances in remote sensing match advances in training and ground-measured traits

### Ebony project
Ebony trees are culturally and economically important but they take a very very long time to grow, so people planting them will not see the benefit within their lifetimes.
- coupling them with planting other native species that are economically and nutritionally important makes more of an incentive to participate in reforestation and **ensure more secure land rights.** Gets over the "I'm only using it if I clear the forest" argument.

Research led by indigenous and traditional peoples that no longer live IN but adjacent to the forest is done to help get important information for their own livelihoods.
- forest phenology - drone and ground-based monitoring, people go to the forest and point to which trees they want to be included in the phenology dataset
- characterize differences in forest types


NASA cover land use change, deforestation, degradation - understand the role of local and indigenous communities in forest restoration and conservation.

Characterize land cover and land use change and see what drivers and shaping land use change.


==Cultivation for exportation, like coffee and cocoa. That is talked a lot about as a solution - what do you think?==

### Plant-animal interactions
Satellite and drone LiDAR + animal movement/seed dispersers

## PANGEA

Scaling this work across the tropics.

LBA - first time scientists got together to get to know the Amazon as a holistic functioning entity.

thinking of landscapes - coordinated ground, tower, airborne, and spaceborne


reforestation - my main question is optimizing cost. big challenges
regrowth - I see it is a big thing in the white paper.
