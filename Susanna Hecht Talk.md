- Current dangerous situation

- Reflects larger scale macro dynamics

- Reflects political ecologies (tropicality)

- AND ideas of policies that were implemented: Amazonia as experiment

- Ecological outcomes of different Amazonian utopias

- A Natural Experiment 1988/2018/2022

- What can we learn



Amazonia is related to the rest of the world - what happens in China and Middle East relate to it

Utopian thought in relation to political economy: Amazonia has always been a center of utopias.

Ecological and socioecological outcomes of different Amazonian utopias and tropicalities have different outcomes: they aren't just drivers of deforestation.

Amazonia was the colony of the Brazilian empire in 1822 -> continues to be thought of as a colony...

Amazonia is different from temperate forests: it's an old forest in old substrate (been around since before the ice age), and it is anthropogenic (15k years of human activity)

The forest resisted until 1990s. From the military dictatorship, 1964-1984, there was an expansion into the forest. With the 1988 constitution, **we got an "ecostate". (now brazil has an eco-constitution, but it is volatile)** ==Amazonia has been politically up for question, and the center of political instability. Now however, Amazonian governance becomes a big issue, as it is in the intersection of "flailing states".==

==Of all tipping points (antartica, permafrost, coral reefs...), it's the most populated.== There is human agency to transform the dynamics.

The Amazon was seen as an empty space that could be filled by European civilization.

Guarani people migrated from the coast to the area near Bolivia to create "land without evil" - probably has to do with the indigenous fleeing into the interior to flee the Europeans

Resistance utopias: ribeirinhos, caboclos, quilombos, resistencia indigena

Political movements: araguaia uprising, guarista movement, FARC (hidden revolutionary history)

Military states of knowledge: it was a military outpost. there was an urgency that it needed to be occupied and the goal was that science and technology would make it possible to go into the Amazon. Inspired by Comte's positivism.

"vast riches if you can figure out how to do it" Capitalist utopias: Ford, JBS, mining

Euclides da Cunha also thought of the interior also as an ideal: did she mention the Coluna Prestes?

==Armenian mafia in the Amazon??????????==

Formal enterprises (governments behind them, big endeavors into the Amazon) vs. practical utopias (quilombos, indigenous inhabitants)

Tropicality is different from orientalism: colonizing the east is about taking over deserts, where there have been great civilizations that declined. tropicality is about taking over a new "pristine" world




**Autochtonous utopia:** people have been there for about 14k years, used to high diversity, developed diverse and complex engineering and forest management systems. ==Past tropicalities can be really useful now given the destruction, to rebuild.== 

There is a VERY LARGE number of civilizations and engineering, that wasn't made of rock, but ephemeral materials that are harder to find. Mainly in the western side


**Ecotopia:** European idea that wilderness as sublime, humans always have a destructive effect over nature, must separate urban areas from wild ones.


1988 was 100 years from the end of slavery and also the time when indigenous people started being considered.

Deforestation can fall from supporting and funding alternatives

Green commodity changes and markets

Social institutions to support livelihoods, science based policy.

Capital's utopia with Bolsonaro: also a lot of criminal groups in the Amazon (biggest murder rate in south america) and oil exploration.

==Formal utopias have been unstable, not durable or resilient. Informal utopias have durable history and are interactive with formal systems and global economies.==


Amazonian indigenous politics are rising very quickly, there are many alliances and they are very active.

Problems at the macroscale remain: ecuador, peru, bolivia, have issues as narcostates/fragile states


How to get global contribution without creating a new colonialism?
Some of the new boycottes have been raised "deforestation-free commodities", but the chinese don't really care and keep consuming Amazonian meat.
Supporting local activism against climate change within these countries is very important.
The problem is at a local ideological level. Here (Canada) we need to go against major fossil fuel companies.
