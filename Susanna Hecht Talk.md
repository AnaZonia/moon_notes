## Current dangerous situation
Amazonia is related to the rest of the world - what happens in China and Middle East relate to it

Utopian thought in relation to political economy: Amazonia has always been a center of utopias.

Ecological and socioecological outcomes of different Amazonian utopias and tropicalities have different outcomes: they aren't just drivers of deforestation.

Amazonia was the colony of the Brazilian empire in 1822 -> continues to be thought of as a colony...

Amazonia is different from temperate forests: it's an old forest in old substrate (been around since before the ice age), and it is anthropogenic (15k years of human activity)

The forest resisted until 1990s. From the military dictatorship, 1964-1984, there was an expansion into the forest. With the 1988 constitution, we got an "ecostate". ==Amazonia has been politically up for question, and the center of political instability. Now however, Amazonian governance becomes a big issue, as it is in the intersection of "flailing states".==

Of all tipping points, it's the most populated.
