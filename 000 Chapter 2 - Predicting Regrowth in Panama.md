### Fragmentation/human impact
Model probability of disturbance in Panama.

Examine disturbance of edge mature forests

get number of years of disturbance and deforestation before regrowth
does fire affect lag


- [ ] Time since burn
	- Time since last burn is very strongly correlated to number of burns, so it was removed. However, the time since each burn is probably relevant for regrowth, but I am not sure how to include this in the dataframe. For a patch that burned 5 times, or one that burned once, how do I incorporate that? should I make up to 33 columns - one with age for fire 1, other with age for fire 2, and so on?
