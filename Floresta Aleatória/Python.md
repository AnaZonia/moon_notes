## First steps
- Always have a virtual environment. Conda is a sort of a manager for packages and virtual environments, but it's unnecessary - everything can be managed easily with pip and venv.

## Venv

```bash
# the virtual environment is just a directory with the information of the python version used at time of creation.

# install venv
sudo apt install python3.10-venv

# create a new virtual environment
python3 -m venv forest_env

# to create a venv with all the packages from the global installation:
python3 -m venv forest_env --system-site-packages

#activate it 
source venv/bin/activate

#to show only packages installed in this specific environment
pip list --local
pip freeze --local
#exit venv
deactivate

# delete venv
rm -r venv

# write all packages installed in venv in a txt file
pip freeze > requirements.txt

# install all packages from the venv
pip install -r /path/to/requirements.txt

```

## Machine Learning

### TPOT
[TPOT](https://machinelearningmastery.com/tpot-for-automated-machine-learning-in-python/) allows for Automated Machine Learning in Python. I used it to run my model, but so far have not found much improvement in comparison with Optim.
